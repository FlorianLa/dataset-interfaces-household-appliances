## Dataset
The dataset consists of 13,702 with 75,551 manually labled interface elements. There are five different categories: *Pushbuttons*, *Touchbuttons*, *Knobs*, *Sliders*, and *Toggles*.

All images and lables can be found in the releases or on Zenodo.

Further information about the images (e.g., type of device, amount of interface elements, ligthing) is listes in the excel table.

The devision into training, validation, and test set, which we used for training our neuronal model, is listed in the three text files.
This division can be used for further training or test runs of the model. 
For this purpose, all images and lables of the data set must be located in a folder named "elems" (see example). This folder must be in the same location as the three text files.
