## Dataset
The dataset consists of 13,702 with 75,551 manually labled interface elements. There are five different categories: Pushbuttons, Touchbuttons, Knobs, Sliders, and Toggles.

The Excel table lists various details of all labeled images in the dataset.
The three text files contain the division of the image data into training, validation, and test data sets.
This division can be used for further training or test runs of the model. For this purpose, all images of the data set must be located together with the label files in a folder named "elems". The folder must be in the same location as the three text files.
